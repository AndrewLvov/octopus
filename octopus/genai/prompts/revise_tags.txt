Analyze the following tags and suggest improvements to make them more consistent and useful for filtering:

{tags}

tag_mapping:
  old_tag_name: 
    - new_tag_name1
    - new_tag_name2
  # ... more mappings

Guidelines:
1. Split overly specific tags into core concepts
   - "ai in agriculture" -> ["artificial intelligence", "agriculture"]
   - "llm chatbot development" -> ["large language models", "chatbots", "development tools"]

2. Standardize terminology
   - Use "artificial intelligence" instead of "ai"
   - Use "machine learning" instead of "ml"
   - Use "large language models" instead of "llm"

3. Merge similar tags
   - Combine "ai tools" and "ai software" into "artificial intelligence"
   - Combine "ml models" and "machine learning models" into "machine learning"

4. Keep tags:
   - Lowercase
   - Clear and established
   - Broad enough to be useful for filtering
   - Specific enough to be meaningful

5. Core tag categories:
   - Core Technologies: artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, cloud computing
   - AI Subcategories: large language models, computer vision, natural language processing
   - Industries: healthcare, finance, education, agriculture
   - Applications: chatbots, recommendation systems, automation
   - Products: productivity software, development tools, databases

Response must be valid YAML with "tag_mapping" mapping where:
- Keys are existing tag names
- Values are arrays of new tag names to replace them with
- Use [] empty array to keep tag unchanged
- All tag names must be lowercase
