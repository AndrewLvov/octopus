Analyze the following content and provide:
1. A summary (max 10 sentences)
2. Relevant tags/categories with relevance scores from 0.0 to 1.0
3. Important entities mentioned (companies, products, people, frameworks) with relevance scores and context

Content:
<story>
{target_content}
</story>

story post:
<story_post>
{story_content}
</story_post>

<comments>
{comments_content}
</comments>

Respond in the following YAML format:
{{
    "summary": "your summary here",
    "tags": [
        {{"name": "tag name", "score": 0.88}},
        ...
    ],
    "entities": [
        {{
            "name": "entity name",
            "type": "company|product|person|framework",
            "score": 0.35,
            "context": "brief description of how entity is mentioned"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}

Tag Guidelines:
1. Always include base technology tags with scores (0.0 if not relevant):
   - "artificial intelligence"
   - "machine learning"
   - "generative ai"
   - "large language models"
   - "cybersecurity"

2. Use standardized tag names:
   - Use "artificial intelligence" instead of "ai"
   - Use "machine learning" instead of "ml"
   - Use "large language models" for LLM-specific content
   - Use "computer vision" for vision/image AI
   - Use "natural language processing" for text/language AI

3. Split combined concepts into separate tags:
   - If content discusses "AI in healthcare", use both "artificial intelligence" and "healthcare"
   - If about "LLM-powered chatbot", use both "large language models" and "chatbots"

4. Tag Categories to Consider:
   - Core Technologies: "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "blockchain", "cloud computing"
   - AI Subcategories: "large language models", "computer vision", "natural language processing"
   - Industries: "healthcare", "finance", "education", "agriculture"
   - Applications: "chatbots", "recommendation systems", "automation"
   - Products: "productivity software", "development tools", "databases"

Entity Guidelines:
- type must be one of: company, product, person, framework
- score should reflect how prominently the entity is featured (0.0 to 1.0)
- context should be a brief description of how the entity is mentioned or its role

Rules:
- All tag names must be lowercase
- Use clear, established terminology
- Keep tags broad enough to be useful for filtering but specific enough to be meaningful
- Your response should STRICTLY contain only YAML structure without bounding characters
